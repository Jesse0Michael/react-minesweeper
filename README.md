[MINESWEEPER - REACT](https://minesweeper-cb7d3.firebaseapp.com/) is a small learning excercise to make the game Minesweeper in React. 

-------

In an effort to get more frontend experiences, specifically in React, I built a web version of Minesweeper. 
The board will fill up the entire height and width of the window and place bombs randomly at 20% of the open locations.
It will work on any screen size, even mobile. It uses Material Design components to keep a nice and clean look and feel.

The application uses Google Analytics to track user interaction with the website and even uses custom events to track when users win or lose.
It uses Firebase for free web hosting, and CircleCI for continuous integration to automatically build and deploy new changes.
